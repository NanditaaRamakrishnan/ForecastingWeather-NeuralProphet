# ForecastingWeather-NeuralProphet
A time series analysis where the weather is forecasted using Neural Prophet

Time Series Analysis- 
Time Series Analysis is the way of studying the characteristics of the response variable with respect to time, as the independent variable. To estimate the target variable in the name of predicting or forecasting, use the time variable as the point of reference.

## How to analyze Time Series?
Collecting the data and cleaning it
Preparing Visualization with respect to time vs key feature
Observing the stationarity of the series
Developing charts to understand its nature.
Model building – AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA
Extracting insights from prediction

## Components of Time Series Analysis-
Trend: In which there is no fixed interval and any divergence within the given dataset is a continuous timeline. The trend would be Negative or Positive or Null Trend
Seasonality: In which regular or fixed interval shifts within the dataset in a continuous timeline.It would be bell curve or saw tooth

Cyclical: In which there is no fixed interval, uncertainty in movement and its pattern

Irregularity: Unexpected situations/events/scenarios and spikes in a short time span.

## Neural Prophet-
The Neural Prophet model is relatively new and was heavily inspired by Facebook’s earlier Prophet time series forecasting model. NeuralProphet is a neural network based model that uses a PyTorch backend, and has been designed with a modular architecture, allowing extra features to be bolted on in the future.
